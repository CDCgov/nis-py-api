# nis-py-api

Python API to the National Immunization Survey (NIS) data.

:construction: This tool is in alpha development. The API and data schema are not stable.

## Getting started

- This a poetry-enabled project.
- Get a [Socrata app token](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-App-Tokens-and-API-Keys). Copy `scripts/secrets_template.yaml` to `scripts/secrets.yaml` and fill out the `app_token`.
- See `scripts/demo.py` for an example of how to cache and query the data:
  - `nisapi.cache_all_datasets()` to download, clean, and cache data
  - `nisapi.get_nis()` to get a lazy data frame pointing to that locally cached, clean data
  - `nisapi.delete_cache()` to clear the cache, if needed
- See `scripts/demo_clean.py` for an example of a script that you could run while iteratively developing the cleaning code in `nisapi/clean/`.
- See `scripts/demo_cloud.py` for a demo of how the data could be downloaded, cleaned, uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, and then downloaded from there. You will need to fill out the `azure:` keys in `secrets.yaml`.

## Data dictionary

The data have these columns, in order, with these types:

| column              | type    |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| `vaccine`           | String  |
| `geographic_type`   | String  |
| `geographic_value`  | String  |
| `demographic_type`  | String  |
| `demographic_value` | String  |
| `indicator_type`    | String  |
| `indicator_value`   | String  |
| `time_type`         | String  |
| `time_start`        | Date    |
| `time_end`          | Date    |
| `estimate`          | Float64 |
| `lci`               | Float64 |
| `uci`               | Float64 |

Note the paired use of "type" and "value" columns.

Rows that were suppressed in the raw data are dropped. This includes data with suppression flag `"1"`, indicating small sample size, and data with flag `"."`, which may indicate that data were not collected.

### `vaccine`

- One of `"flu"` or `"covid"`

### `geographic_type`

- One of `"nation"`, `"region"`, `"admin1"`, `"substate"`
- "Region" means HHS Region
- First-level administrative divisions include US states, territories, and the District of Columbia

### `geographic_value`

- If `geographic_type` is `"nation"`, then this is `"nation"`
- If `"region"`, then a string of the form `"Region 1"`
- If `"admin1"`, then the full name of the jurisdiction
- If `"substate"`, no validation is currently applied

### `demographic_type`

- There are multiple types, including `"overall"` and `"age"`
- Note that "overall" might refer only to certain age groups (e.g., 18+)

### `demographic_value`

- If `demographic_type` is `"overall"`, then this is `"overall"`
- If `demographic_type` is `"age"`, then this is the age group, with the form `"x-y years"` or `"x+ years"`

### `indicator_type`

- Always `"4-level vaccination and intent"`

### `indicator_value`

- The value of the indicator, e.g., `"received a vaccination"`

### `time_type`

- One of `"monthly"` or `"weekly"`

### `time_start` and `time_end`

Period of time associated with the observation. Note that "monthly" and "weekly" observations do not always align with calendar weeks or months, so we specify the two dates explicitly.

### `estimate`

- Proportion (i.e., a number between 0 and 1) of the population (defined by geography and demography) that has the characteristic described by the indicator

### `lci` and `uci`

The lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval, measured in the same units as `estimate`

### Adding a new dataset

1. Annotate the dataset ID and URL in `datasets.yaml`
2. Use a script like `scripts/demo_clean.py` to iterate when formulating the cleaning steps.

When adding a new dataset, include demonstrations that the content of the clean data is what you expected.
