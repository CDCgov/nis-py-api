# nis-py-api

Python API to access parts of the [National Immunization Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nis/about/index.html) (NIS) data available via <https://data.cdc.gov/>. This package helps with data download, cleaning, and caching, ensuring quick access to data that have consistent field names and certain validations.

## Getting started

- This a poetry-enabled project. Use `poetry install` to install.
- Get a [Socrata app token](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-App-Tokens-and-API-Keys). Copy `scripts/secrets_template.yaml` to `scripts/secrets.yaml` and fill out the `app_token`.
- See `scripts/demo.py` for an example of how to cache and query the data:
  - `python -m nisapi cache app_token={SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN}` or `nisapi.cache_all_datasets(app_token={SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN})` to download, clean, and cache data
  - `nisapi.get_nis()` to get a lazy data frame pointing to that locally cached, clean data
  - `python -m nisapi delete` or `nisapi.delete_cache()` to delete the cache, if needed
- See `scripts/demo_clean.py` for an example of a script that you could run while iteratively developing the cleaning code in `nisapi/clean/`.
- See `scripts/demo_cloud.py` for a demo of how the data could be downloaded, cleaned, uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, and then downloaded from there. You will need to fill out the `azure:` keys in `secrets.yaml`.
- Run `streamlit run scripts/demo_streamlit.py` to quickly query and visualize the data with a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app.

## Data dictionary

The data have these columns, in order, with these types:

| column           | type    |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| `vaccine`        | String  |
| `geography_type` | String  |
| `geography`      | String  |
| `domain_type`    | String  |
| `domain`         | String  |
| `indicator_type` | String  |
| `indicator`      | String  |
| `time_type`      | String  |
| `time_start`     | Date    |
| `time_end`       | Date    |
| `estimate`       | Float64 |
| `lci`            | Float64 |
| `uci`            | Float64 |

Note the pairs `geography_type` and `geography`, `domain_type` and `domain`, and `indicator_type` and `indicator`.

Rows that were suppressed in the raw data are dropped. This includes data with suppression flag `"1"`, indicating small sample size, and data with flag `"."`, which may indicate that data were not collected.

### `vaccine`

- One of `"flu"` or `"covid"`

### `geography_type`

- One of `"nation"`, `"region"`, `"admin1"`, `"substate"`, `"county"`
- "Region" means HHS Region
- First-level administrative divisions (`"admin1"`) include US states, territories, and the District of Columbia
- "Substate" includes:
  - Chicago, and the rest of Illinois
  - New York City, and the rest of New York
  - Philadelphia, and the rest of Pennsylvania
  - Bexar County, City of Houston, and the rest of Texas

### `geography`

- If `geography_type` is `"nation"`, then this is `"nation"`
- If `"region"`, then a string of the form `"Region 1"`
- If `"admin1"`, then the full name of the jurisdiction
- If `"substate"`, no validation is currently applied
- If `"county"`, then the 5-digit FIPS code

### `domain_type`

- There are multiple types, including `"age"`

### `domain`

- If `domain_type` is `"age"`, then this is the age group, with the form `"x-y years"`, `"x-y months"`, `"x+ years"`, `"x+ months"`, or `"x months-y years"`

### `indicator_type`

- In newer data, this is always `"4-level vaccination and intent"`
- In historical COVID-19 and flu data, there are a wide range of indicators

### `indicator`

- The value of the indicator, e.g., `"received a vaccination"`

### `time_type`

- One of `"month"` or `"week"`

### `time_start` and `time_end`

- Period of time associated with the observation. Note that "monthly" and "weekly" observations do not always align with calendar weeks or months, so we specify the two dates explicitly.
- Certain assumptions were made about `time_start` dates for datasets that provided "week ending" dates.
- Time start is always before time end.

### `estimate`

- Proportion (i.e., a number between 0 and 1) of the population (defined by geography and domain) that has the characteristic described by the indicator

### `lci` and `uci`

- The lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval, measured in the same units as `estimate`
- Confidence interval always bracket the `estimate`

## Contributing

### Adding a new dataset

1. Find the dataset you want to clean on <https://data.cdc.gov/>.
2. Add the dataset to `nisapi/datasets.yaml`.
   - At a minimum, you must include the dataset ID.
   - It is helpful to also include URL, vaccine, date range, and universe.
3. Create a dataset-specific module in `nisapi/clean/`. It should have a main function `clean()`.
   - Start with a `clean()` function that does nothing and just returns the input data frame.
4. Add the `import` and `elif` statements for this dataset ID to `clean_dataset()` in `nisapi/clean/__init__.py`.
5. Run `scripts/clean_demo.py`. This should cache the raw dataset, run the cleaning function, and fail on validation.
6. Iteratively update the dataset-specific `clean()` function until validation passes.
   - Ideally, `clean()` should be a series of pipe functions.
   - If a cleaning step is specific to a single dataset, keep that in the dataset-specific submodule. If a step is shared between datasets, move it into `helpers.py`.
   - If multiple indicators are redundant, validate that redundancy in code, and then pick only one indicator. (E.g., `ksfb-ug5d` and `sw5n-wg2p` drop the up-to-date indicator in favor of the 4-level vaccination intent indicator.)
   - If you find some dataset-specific anomaly or validation problem, make a note of it in `datasets.yaml`.
7. Open a PR.
   - Include any validations if you needed to correct an anomaly.
