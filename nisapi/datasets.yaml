  notes:
    - One row (national, Pacific Islander, 2023-04-29) has a suppression flag, a null sample size, but a non-null estimate. This row was dropped.
    - "There is a typo column in column names: `estimates` rather than `estimate`"
    - When domain type is "overall"`, domain value is "18+ years". Clean data changes this value to "age".
    - There are some rows that are duplicated, except for point estimate and CIs, which are rounded to different places. Clean data takes the mean over these rows.
    - In some cases, the estimate minus the half 95% CI yields a value lower than 0. In those cases, the lower bound is replaced with zero.

  notes:
    - This appears to be a replacement for udsf-9v7b
    - udsf-9v7b had these suppression flags notes:
        - All null-estimate and "1"-flagged rows were dropped.
        - "16 rows have the expected pattern; flag '1' and a null value."
        - 12 rows have sample size < 30, and they all have flag "0".
        - 1399 rows have flag "1" but non-null estimates.
        - Suppression flags include non-standard value "0.0".
    - Two rows had estimates of zero and no CIs (despite having nonzero sample size); North Dakota and Alaska in Nov 28-Dec 31. These CIs were writted as null. Maybe also West Virginia for 2022-01.

  vaccine: flu
  start_date: 2009-08-01
  universe: 6+ months old
  notes:
    - Includes seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1 monovalent vaccines.
    - H1N1 vaccines had two age groups "25-64 years not in initial target group" and "25-64 years not in initial target group". These were collapsed into "at high risk" and "not at high risk", to be consistent with other age groups.
    - County-level data are reported by survey year rather than influenza season.

  vaccine: covid
  start_date: 2023-09-30
  universe: 6 months - 17 years old
  notes:
    - Dates in the "week_ending" column have no times, requiring a version of the `cast_types` helper specific to this dataset
    - Contains two unnecessary columns, "month_week" and "unweighted_sample_size," which must be dropped

  vaccine: flu
  start_date: 2019-10-05
  universe: 6 months - 17 years old
  notes:
    - The 'vaccine' column is missing, so "flu" must be filled in
    - There are 585 with geographic_level "Local" (e.g. City of Chicago). This is new, but permitted by validation.
    - There are 2580 rows with "null" estimates that must be dropped.
    - There is an empty indicator type "", often paired with indicator "Yes", but this does not appear synonymous with any other indicator.

  vaccine: rsv
  start_date: 2024-08-24
  universe: 75+ years and 60-74 years old with high risk conditions
  notes:
    - The column "suppression_flag" is misspelled as "suppresion_flag"
    - The columns that are usually named "geographic_type" and "geographic_level" are instead "geography_type" and "geography_level"
    - An "age_group" column, divides every entry into "60-74 years (high risk)" vs. "75+ years" even when "domain_type" is not "overall" i.e. age

  - The data is monthly but includes the full cross of state-level geography and adult age groups for all three vaccinations, for 2024-25
