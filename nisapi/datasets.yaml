  notes:
    - One row (national, Pacific Islander, 2023-04-29) has a suppression flag, a null sample size, but a non-null estimate. This row was dropped.
    - "There is a typo column in column names: `estimates` rather than `estimate`"
    - When demographic type is "overall"`, demographic value "18+ years". Clean data changes this value to "overall".
    - There are some rows that are duplicated, except for point estimate and CIs, which are rounded to different places. Clean data takes the mean over these rows.
    - In some cases, the estimate minus the half 95% CI yields a value lower than 0. In those cases, the lower bound is replaced with zero.

    - Suppression flags:
        - All null-estimate and "1"-flagged rows were dropped.
        - "16 rows have the expected pattern: flag '1' and a null value."
        - 12 rows have sample size < 30, and they all have flag "0".
        - 1399 rows have flag "1" but non-null estimates.
        - Suppression flags include non-standard value "0.0".
