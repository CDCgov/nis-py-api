  notes:
    - One row (national, Pacific Islander, 2023-04-29) has a suppression flag, a null sample size, but a non-null estimate. This row was dropped.
    - "There is a typo column in column names: `estimates` rather than `estimate`"
    - When demographic type is "overall"`, demographic value "18+ years". Clean data changes this value to "overall".
    - There are some rows that are duplicated, except for point estimate and CIs, which are rounded to different places. Clean data takes the mean over these rows.
    - In some cases, the estimate minus the half 95% CI yields a value lower than 0. In those cases, the lower bound is replaced with zero.
